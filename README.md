# F-16 Flight Dynamics and Simulation

## Overview
This project focuses on modeling and simulating the flight dynamics of an F-16 aircraft using six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). The key objectives include:

1. Extracting flight parameters for the F-16 in both lateral and longitudinal channels.
2. Developing a simulation environment in Simulink using the obtained flight parameters.
3. Visualizing the simulation results in FlightGear.

## Steps and Implementation

### 1. **Flight Dynamics Analysis**
We derived the flight dynamics of the F-16 by analyzing its six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). The lateral and longitudinal channels were examined to obtain:
- Stability derivatives
- Control derivatives
- Equations of motion for roll, pitch, and yaw dynamics

### 2. **Simulink Model Development**
Using the extracted flight parameters, a comprehensive Simulink model was developed to simulate the aircraft's behavior. This included:
- Implementation of the equations of motion
- Integration of control inputs for realistic piloting scenarios
- Modeling environmental conditions such as gravity, drag, and lift

### 3. **FlightGear Integration**
To visualize the simulated flight:
- The Simulink model was linked with FlightGear using the FlightGear interface blocks.
- Real-time data was transmitted from Simulink to FlightGear, allowing for a live 3D visualization of the F-16's flight dynamics.
